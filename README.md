## Running the sample

1. Make sure you have the [NativeScript Command-line Interface](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript) installed as well as all the prerequisites for the NativeScript development, described in the package page.
2. Install the dev dependencies of the sample (TypeScript) and add preferred platforms. Note that iOS development is only available with a Mac machine.  
     `tns install`
3. Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript  
     `node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc -p ./app`
4. Run the project.

    `tns run ios|android [--emulator]`

    The `--emulator` keyword instructs the CLI to load the iOS simulator or an android emulator depending on the platform you want.


For convenience you can use the `run.bat`/`run.sh` scripts on a \*NIX/windows environment respectively. The `run.sh` script starts the sample in iOS when run on a Mac and Android on Linux/Windows. The `run.bat` script runs the sample on an Android emulator under Windows.

For \*NIX systems the following script runs the sample directly:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NativeScript/sample-Xpensity/master/run.sh | bash`
